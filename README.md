# Registration_System
Simple console app for Registration_System using cpp
The start menu contains 4 options: sign up, log in, forget password, and Exit.
I used a set data structure to store user names and passwords, and I made sure that we couldn't repeat the same user name,
and I used a map data structure to store all other data and used the user name as the key.
